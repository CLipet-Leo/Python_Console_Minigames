# Python Project

## Overview

This project contains various Python games and exercises done during my studies, organized into two main categories: advanced English code (2nd year) and beginner French code (1st year).

## Games

### Tic-tac-toe
- A classic game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid.

### Rock-paper-scissors
- A hand game usually played between two people, where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes.

## Project Structure

### English Code (Advanced)
- [GameManager.py](English-code-(advanced)/GameManager.py): Manages the game flow and player turns.
- [Player.py](English-code-(advanced)/Player.py): Defines the player class and player actions.
- [Robot.py](English-code-(advanced)/Robot.py): Contains the robot player logic.
- [tempCodeRunnerFile.py](English-code-(advanced)/tempCodeRunnerFile.py): Temporary file for code execution.

### French Code (Beginner)
- [morpion-ai.py](French-code-(beginner)/morpion-ai.py): AI implementation for the Tic-tac-toe game.
- [morpion-pseudo-code.py](French-code-(beginner)/morpion-pseudo-code.py): Pseudo-code for Tic-tac-toe.
- [morpion-pvp.py](French-code-(beginner)/morpion-pvp.py): Player vs Player Tic-tac-toe game.
- [pfc-pseudo-code.py](French-code-(beginner)/pfc-pseudo-code.py): Pseudo-code for Rock-paper-scissors.
- [pierre-feuille-ciseau-python.py](French-code-(beginner)/pierre-feuille-ciseau-python.py): Rock-paper-scissors game in Python.
- [test-morpion-gamemode.py](French-code-(beginner)/test-morpion-gamemode.py): Tests for different Tic-tac-toe game modes.

#### Exercices et Tests
- [exercice.py](French-code-(beginner)/exercices-et-tests/exercice.py): Various beginner exercises.
- [suite-conway.py](French-code-(beginner)/exercices-et-tests/suite-conway.py): Implementation of Conway's Game of Life.
- [suite-fibonacci.py](French-code-(beginner)/exercices-et-tests/suite-fibonacci.py): Fibonacci sequence exercises.
